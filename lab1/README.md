## **Foundation lab 1** - Data types and Characteristics

**Required Pre-Reading:**

[Learning Analytics Goes to School, (Ch. 2, pp. 15 - 28) By Andrew Krumm, Barbara Means, Marie Bienkowski](https://laser-institute.github.io/LASER_Foundations_2023/lab1/Readings/Learning%20Analytics%20Goes%20to%20School.pdf)

[Educational data mining and learning analytics: An updated survey. By Romero, C., & Ventura, S.](https://laser-institute.github.io/LASER_Foundations_2023/lab1/Readings/Educational_data_mining_and_learning_analytics.pdf)


**[Foundation Presentation - One](https://laser-institute.github.io/LASER_Foundations_2023/lab1/found-lab-1-slides.html#1) and code-along:**
This presentation is a review of the types of data typically used to perform learning analytics in education. The focus of the essential readings are to introduce LASER Scholars to the most common data structures used in Learning Analytics. We will look closely at Digital Learning Environments, Administrative Data and Sensors / Multimodal. 


The code-along includes introduction of commonly used packages that read in different data types. Scholars learn to use the readr package from tidyverse to organize data into data frames and tibbles. Additionally, scholars will learn how to read in files using the Haven package.  

Case Study work includes:
- Prepare
  + How to read in Packages
    + Tidyverse Package


**Required Work:**

- Make sure to complete the R Programming primers:  [Work with Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2))
