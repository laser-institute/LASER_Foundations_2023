## 0. Introduction

We will continue working with the **data_to_explore** data frame we created consisting of our merged *gradebook*, *log data*, and *survey data*.

In this session we will:

-   Learn to *explore* using [`GGPLOT` package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

-   Learn *model* by predicting a varibale and then visualize it using `GGPLOT`.

-   Learn to *communicate* our findings in a dashboard using [`Flexdashboard` package](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/).

## 1. Prepare

In the code chunk below, we will:

1.  load the *tidyverse* and *here* packages
2.  Read in the 'data_to_explore.csv' file located in the data folder
3.  Save your data to a new object named data_to_viz.
4.  View the data

```{r}
# Load tidyverse library by adding the package name
library(tidyverse)
# Load here library by adding the correct function
library(here)


# Read in data
data_to_viz <- read_csv(here("part3-dataviz-quarto", "data", "data_to_explore.csv"))

# visualize the data using a method of your choice

```

## 2. Wrangle

We've already wrangled out data - but let's look at the data frame to make sure it is still correct. A quick way to look at the data frame is with the [`skimr` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/skimr/vignettes/skimr.html).

This output is best for internal use.

This is because the output is rich, but not well-suited to exporting to a table that you add, for instance, to a Google Docs or Microsoft Word manuscript. Of course, these values can be entered manually into a table, but we'll also discuss ways later on to create tables that are ready, or nearly-ready-to be added directly to manuscripts.

First, install and load the package. Normally you would do this above but we want to make sure you know which packages are used with the new functions.

```{r}
#install package if this is first time using skimr copy the code below without the hashtag and run in the console
#install.packages("skimr")

#load library by adding skimr as the package name
library(skimr)

```

Second, use the `skim()` function to view the data

```{r}
#skim the data by adding the skim function infront of the data
skim(data_to_viz)
```

you can also skim by a group such as the `subject` variable

```{r}
data_to_viz %>%
  group_by(subject) %>% 
  skim() 
```

## 3. Explore

#### GGplot grammar - with layers

GGplot is designed to work iteratively. You start with a layer that shows the raw data. Then you add layers of annotations and statistical summaries.

You can read more about ggplot in the book ["GGPLOT: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis"](https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html). You can also find lots of inspiration in the [r-graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) that includes code. Finally you can use the GGPLOT cheat sheet to help.

![](img/grammar.png){width="600"}

" Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" states that "every ggplot2 plot has three key components:

-   data,

-   A set of aesthetic mappings between variables in the data and visual properties, and

-   At least one layer which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a geom function."

### One Conitnous varibale

Create a basic visualization that examines a continuous variable of interest.

#### Barplot

#### Which online course had the largest enrollment numbers?

Which variable should we be looking at?

```{r}
#look at the data frame

```

#### Level a. The most basic level for a plot

Includes:

-   **data**: data_to_explore.csv
-   \***`aes()` function** - one continuous variable:
    -   subject mapped to x position
-   **Geom**:`geom_bar()` function - bar graph

```{r}
#layer 1: add data 
# layer 2: add aesthetics mapping
#ggplot(data_to_viz, aes(x = subject)) +
#layer 3: add geom 
#  geom_bar() +

```

#### Level b. Add another layer with labels

-   **title**: "Number of Student Enrollments per Subject"
-   **caption**: "Which online courses have had the largest enrollment numbers?"

```{r}
#layer 1: add data 
# layer 2: add aesthetics mapping
ggplot(data_to_viz, aes(x = subject)) +
#layer 3: add geom 
  geom_bar() +

#layer 4: add labels
    labs(title = "Number of Student Enrollments per Subject",
       caption = "Which online courses have had the largest enrollment numbers?")
```

#### Level c: Add **Scale** with a different color.

-   **scale**: fill = gender

##### What can we notice about gender?

```{r}
#layer 1: add data 
# layer 2: add aesthetics mapping and #layer 5 scale
ggplot(data_to_viz, aes(x = subject, fill = gender)) +
#layer 3: add geom 
  geom_bar() +

#layer 4: add labels
    labs(title = "Gender Distribution of Students Across Subjects",
       caption = "Which subjects enroll more female students?")

```

#### Histogram - You try

-   **data**: data_to_viz
-   **`aes()` function** - one continuous variables:
    -   `tv` variable mapped to x position
-   **Geom**: geom_histogram() *this code is already there you just need to un-comment it.*
-   Add a **title** ""Number of Hours Students Watch TV per Day"
-   Add a **caption** that poses the question "Approximately how many students watch 4+ hours of TV per day?"

**NEED HELP? [TRY STHDA](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-histogram-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization)**

```{r}
#add data

# add the geom

#add geom
#geom_histogram(bins = 5) +

#add the labs




```

Yours could look like something below...

```{r}
ggplot(data_to_viz, aes(x = tv)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 5) +
  labs(title = "Number of Hours Students Watch TV per Day", 
       caption = "Approximately how many students watch 4+ hours of TV per day?")
```

or

```{r}
data_to_viz%>%
  ggplot(aes(x= tv))+
# layer 2: add histogram geom 
# layer 3a: add bin size
# layer 3b: add color
  geom_histogram(bins = 5, fill = "red", colour = "black")+
  labs(title = "Number of Hours Students Watch TV per Day", 
       caption = "Approximately how many students watch 4+ hours of TV per day?") +
  theme_classic()
```

### Two categorical Variables

Create a basic visualization that examines the relationship between two categorical variables.

##### What do you wonder about the reasons for enrollment in various courses?

#### Heatmap

-   \***data**: data_to_viz
-   use `count()` function for `subject`, `enrollment` then,
-   `ggplot()` function
-   **`aes()` function** - one continuous variables
    -   `subject` variable mapped to x position
    -   `enrollment reason` variable mapped to x position
-   **Geom**: `geom_tile()` function
-   Add a **title** "Reasons for Enrollment by Subject"
-   Add a \***caption** that poses the question "Which subjects were the least available at local schools?"

```{r}
data_to_viz %>% 
  count(subject, enrollment_reason) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_tile(mapping = aes(x = subject, 
                          y = enrollment_reason, 
                          fill = n)) + 
  labs(title = "Reasons for Enrollment by Subject", 
       caption = "Which subjects were the least available at local schools?")
```

### Two continuous variables

Create a basic visualization that examines the relationship between two continuous variables.

#### Scatter plot

##### Can we predict the grade on a course from the time spent in the course LMS?

Which variables should we be looking at?

```{r}
#look at the data frame

```

#### Level a. The most basic level for a plot

Includes:

-   **data**: data_to_explore.csv
-   **`aes()` function** - two continuous variables
    -   time spent in hours mapped to x position
    -   proportion earned mapped to y position
-   **Geom**: `geom_point()` function - Scatter plot

ggplot(data_to_viz,
       aes(x = time_spent_hours, 
           y = proportion_earned)) +
#layer 2: +  geom function type
  geom_point() 
```

#### Level b. Add another layer with labels

-   Add a **x label**: "Time Spent (Hours)"
-   Add a **y label**: "Proportion of Points Earned"

```{r}
#layer 1: add data and aesthetics mapping 
#layer 3: add color scale by type
ggplot(data_to_viz, 
       aes(x = time_spent_hours,

       x="Time Spent (Hours)",
       y = "Proportion of Points Earned")+
  facet_wrap(~ subject) 
```

## 4. MODEL

### Predict Achievement and plot

##### Linear Regression

In brief, a linear regression model involves estimating the relationships between one or more *independent variables* with one dependent variable. Mathematically, it can be written like the following.

$$
\operatorname{dependentvar} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}(\operatorname{independentvar}) + \epsilon
$$

Does time spent predict grade earned?

The following code estimates a model in which `proportion_earned`, the proportion of points students earned, is the dependent variable. It is predicted by one independent variable, `time_pent_hours`, students' time spent on the course LMS.

```{r messages=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lm(proportion_earned ~ time_spent_hours, 
   data = data_to_viz)
```

Note that that estimate for time spent is .005, so for every one-unit increase in `time_spent_hours`, we should expect a 5 percentage point increase in their grade.

Plot the linear model with: `geom_smooth` function and method = "lm" which fits a linear model, giving the line of best fit.

```{r}
data_to_viz %>%
  drop_na(enrollment_status) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time_spent_hours, 
             y = proportion_earned, 
             color = enrollment_status)) +
  geom_point() +
# add geom_smooth for lm
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
  labs(title="How Time Spent on Course LMS is Related to Points Earned in the Course", 
       x="Time Spent (Hours)",
       y = "Proportion of Points Earned")+
  facet_wrap(~ subject) 
```

##### Multiple regression

We can add another variable for science interest called `int` varibale.

```{r messages=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Add predictor variable for science
lm(proportion_earned ~ time_spent_hours + int, 
   data = data_to_viz)
```

We can see that the intercept is now estimated at 0.44, which tells us that when students' time spent and interest are equal to zero, they are likely fail the course unsurprisingly. Note that that estimate for interest in science is .046, so for every one-unit increase in `int`, we should expect an 5 percentage point increase in their grade.

We can save the output of the function to an object---let's say `m1`, standing for model 1. We can then use the `summary()` function built into R to view a much more feature-rich summary of the estimated model.

```{r messages=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# save the model
m1 <- lm(proportion_earned ~ time_spent_hours + int, data = data_to_viz)

```

Run a summary model for the model you just created called, `m1.`

```{r messages=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#run the summary
summary(m1)

```

##### Summarize predictors

the `summarize()` function from the {dplyr} package used to create summary statistics such as the mean, standard deviation, or the minimum or maximum of a value. At its core, think of `summarize()` as a function that returns a single value (whether it's a mean, median, standard deviation---whichever!) that summarizes a single column.

```{r messages=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data_to_viz %>% 
  summarize(mean_interest = mean(int, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_time = mean(time_spent_hours, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The mean value for interest is quite high. If we multiply the estimate relationship between interest and proportion of points earned---0.046---by this, the mean interest across all of the students---we can determine that students' estimate final grade was 0.046 X 4.3, or **0.197**. For hours spent spent, the average students' estimate final grade was 0.0042 X 30.48, or **0.128**.

If we add both 0.197 and 0.128 to the intercept, 0.449, that equals 0.774, or about 77%. In other words, a student with average interest in science who spent an average amount of time in the course earned a pretty average grade.

## 5. Communicate

We are going to pick 2 graph and tell a story in a flex dashboard.

We need to open 'flexdashboard_template' file.

We also have a 'flexdashboard_example' file.
