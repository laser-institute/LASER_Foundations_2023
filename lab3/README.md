### **Foundation-lab 3** - Data Visualization


**Required Pre-Reading:**


1. [Data Visualization: A practical Introduction (CH. 1 & 3) by Kieren Healy](https://socviz.co/)(Feel free to skim)
2. [R for Data Science. (CH. 3) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)


**Presentation and code-along:**
The overview introduces and reviews some of the basic principles of data visualization as it relates to data graphics, including data visualization perception and color.

The accompanying code-along takes a deep dive into the ggplot2 grammar in a simple-to-understand layering approach. We will look at a representation of numeric variables using some of the most popular geoms, histogram and scatter plot, and put it all together to answer a research question. 
At the end of this code-along participants will understand the "hows" of ggplots aesthetics.
