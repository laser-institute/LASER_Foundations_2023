**[Foundations Presentation - Three](https://laser-institute.github.io/LASER_Foundations_2023/lab3/found-lab-3-slides.html#1) and code-along:**
The overview introduces and reviews some of the basic principles of data visualization as it relates to data graphics, including data visualization perception and color.

DATA VISUALIZATION in LA

- Benefits of Data Visualization
- Types of Data Visualization 
- Real-world Examples of Data Viz 
- Best Practices

The accompanying code-along takes a deep dive into the ggplot2 grammar in a simple-to-understand layering approach. We will look at a representation of numeric variables using some of the most popular geoms, histogram and scatter plot, and put it all together to answer a research question. At the end of this code-along participants will understand the "hows" of ggplots aesthetics. 

Case Study work includes:
- EXPLORE
  + `ggplot2` grammar
  + Scatter plot
  + Histogram
