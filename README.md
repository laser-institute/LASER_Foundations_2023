### Foundation of Learning Analytics for STEM Education Research

Foundation knowledge is the base knowledge of which new knowledge is built. Learning Analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs (Siemens, 2011).

These foundation labs allow for the gentle introduction of conceptual understanding of foundation of learning analytics along with R programming basics for STEM Education Research. 


## **Foundation lab 1** - Data Sources

**Required Pre-Reading:**

[Learning Analytics Goes to School, (Ch. 2, pp. 15 - 28) By Andrew Krumm, Barbara Means, Marie Bienkowski](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/blob/main/foundation_labs/foundlab_1/krumm_2018.pdf)


**[Foundation Presentation - One](https://laser-institute.github.io/foundational-skills/foundation_lab_1/index.html) and code-along:**
This presentation is a review of the types of data typically used to perform learning analytics in education. The focus of the essential readings are to introduce LASER Scholars to the most common data structures used in Learning Analytics. We will look closely at Digital Learning Environments, Administrative Data and Sensors / Multimodal. 

TYPES:

- Digital Learning Environments
- Games and Simulations
- MOOCs
- Intelligent Tutoring Systems
- Learning Management Systems

CHARACTERISTIC of DATA

- Structured
- Unstructured
- Semi-Structured
- Meta-Data


The code-along includes introduction of a script file and commonly used packages that read in different data types. Scholars learn to use the readr package from tidyverse to organize data into data frames and tibbles. Additionally, scholars will learn how to read in files using the Haven package.  

- Reading in Data
- Packages
- Common Functions


**Required Work:**

- Make sure to complete the R Programming primers:  [Work with Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2))


**Badge Requirement**

- Complete the Badge requirement document[Foundations badge - Data Sources](https://laser-institute.github.io/foundational-skills/foundation_lab_1/lab1_badge/foundationlab1_badge.html).


Written by Jeanne McClure, Catherine Noonan, and Shaun Kellogg. Presented by Jeanne McClure and Jenn Houchins at the Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) workshop, July 11, 2022, through July 15, 2022, at the Friday Institute, North Carolina State University.

## **Foundation lab 2** - Learning Analytics Workflow


**Required Pre-Reading:**

1. [Learning Analytics Goes to School, (Ch. 2, pp. 28 - 33) By Andrew Krumm, Barbara Means, Marie Bienkowski](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/blob/main/foundation_labs/foundlab_1/krumm_2018.pdf)

## **Foundation-lab 3** - Data Visualization


**Required Pre-Reading:**


1. [Data Visualization: A practical Introduction (CH. 1 & 3) by Kieren Healy](https://socviz.co/)(Feel free to skim)


2. [R for Data Science. (CH. 3) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)


**[Foundations Presentation - Three](https://laser-institute.github.io/foundational-skills/foundation_lab_3/intro_dataviz.html)and code-along:**
The overview introduces and reviews some of the basic principles of data visualization as it relates to data graphics, including data visualization perception and color.

DATA VISUALIZATION

- Purpose of Visualizations
- Principles
  + Perception
  + Color
  + Cognitive Processing

The accompanying code-along takes a deep dive into the ggplot2 grammar in a simple-to-understand layering approach. We will look at a representation of numeric variables using some of the most popular geoms, histogram and scatter plot, and put it all together to answer a research question. At the end of this code-along participants will understand the "hows" of ggplots aesthetics. 

PHASE OF WORKFLOW

- EXPLORE
  + `ggplot2` grammar
  + Scatter plot
  + Histogram

**Required Work:**

-  Make sure to complete the R Programming primer: [Introduction to data visualization](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3))
