## Foundation of Learning Analytics for STEM Education Research

 Foundation knowledge is the base knowledge of which new knowledge is built. Learning Analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs (Siemens, 2011).

 These foundation labs allow for the gentle introduction of conceptual understanding of foundation of learning analytics along with R programming basics for STEM Education Research.

This presentation is a review of the types of data typically used to perform learning analytics in education. The focus of the essential readings are to introduce LASER Scholars to the most common data structures used in Learning Analytics. We will look closely at Digital Learning Environments, Administrative Data and Sensors / Multimodal. 


The code-along includes introduction of commonly used packages that read in different data types. Scholars learn to use the readr package from tidyverse to organize data into data frames and tibbles. Additionally, scholars will learn how to read in files using the Haven package.

- Best Practices

The accompanying code-along takes a deep dive into the ggplot2 grammar in a simple-to-understand layering approach. We will look at a representation of numeric variables using some of the most popular geoms, histogram and scatter plot, and put it all together to answer a research question. At the end of this code-along participants will understand the "hows" of ggplots aesthetics. 

Case Study work includes:
